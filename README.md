In this data science and machine learning project, we classify  some persons . We restrict classification to only 5 people,

Aman
Arvind
Ayush 
Sakib 
Virat Kohli ( added , so that testing for anyone would be easier ) 

Here is the folder structure =>  
UI : This contains ui website code
server: Python flask server
model: Contains python notebook for model building
   ( in model folder , I removed dataset folder , which contained images of everyone , because it consumed more than 2 gb ) .

Technologies used in this project => 
Python
Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

For Deployment => 
AWS Console 
Ngnix 
WinSCP
Git Bash.
Please read Project_Image_Classification.ipynb file for deployment related query.
